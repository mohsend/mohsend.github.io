I’m starting to realize that good things don’t get made in one sitting. They take time over several sessions. Leaving for a day and revising your work makes all the difference between mediocre and extraordinary.

Also having someone around, even if they don’t directly involve  with your work can make a huge difference.

Good things take time; sleep on it.
