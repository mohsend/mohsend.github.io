It’s been a while since I practiced _free writing_. And not-so-coincidentally It’s been the same while since my last exam. The struggle is real people! 

<!--more-->

Anyway, I wasn’t exactly a worthless piece of some usually-brown matter in the past few days. I finally settled on _middleman_[^middleman] as my static site builder of choice to host these writings and actually did go all the way of implenting it. Which wasn’t a cake walk by any means. The commands from the official documentation didn't work for me![^bundle] Someone should write a good getting started on this thing for people who are not familiar with _ruby_. To be real someone probably have done already, But I didn’t happen to stumble upon such thing. By the way I just ---in the middle of typing--- decided to link to the project[^casper] that actually finally made it work the way I wanted it to after a day of dealing with errors. Be this a thank you to those people.

[^middleman]: [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) is an static website builder written in ruby.

[^bundle]: I should have appended `bundle exec` to the begining of the commands in the doc for some reason. 

[^casper]: [middleman-casper](https://github.com/danielbayerlein/middleman-casper) is an elegant theme for middleman. As of writing, this blog uses this theme.
