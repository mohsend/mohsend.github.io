Way past midnight I contacted a friend and I’m glad that I did.

 We share a lot of feelings and thoughts. I consider myself privileged and lucky to have been found by such friend. There were a lot of ---renowned--- people who were deprived of this gift. Sad for them but lucky for us, those people found solace in papers and pens and now a lot of us can read what left behind and feel connected.

I’m also grateful about the technology that enables us to talk to each other this late at night and over such considerable distance. 

I long to see him again in person.
