It amazes me every time I think about how enabling computers are.
When used correctly even a very underpowered one can be a powerful tool to do incredible things. Coupled with the Internet, everyone with a PC has unlimited information at disposal, and can also contribute with information of one's own.
Each time I think about the possibilities the more excited I become.

_**What a time to be alive!**_
