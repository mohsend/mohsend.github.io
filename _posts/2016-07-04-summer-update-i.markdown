It’s been a long time since my last post here. 
Mainly because I haven’t been practicing freewriting lately. 
I’m not as passionate about writing as I used to be a few months ago. 
It may be since I’m not currently reading any work of fiction. 

This is the first post after my university exams and I want to focus on what I did on the first 13 days of summer. Starting a whole new category (Update).

As you can see in [this post](https://mehsen.com/freewritings/2016/01/09/for-when-im-bored/), written during last semester’s exams, there’s always a flood of new ideas on a variety of things you want to do during exams that you can’t afford to do then and there; because you have to spend as much as you can on studying. In the same post I presented a solution to get rid of those thoughts during exams, *and* not being bored afterwards. The idea was to write them all down. And that’s basically what I did.   

These days I’m going through that to-do list. A lot of them don’t look that appealing now, but some of them are still looking good. This list saved me from boredom and inaction so far.  

Traditionally I spent summers doing nothing. I was and still am an expert in that. Not Patrick-Star-level, but impressive nevertheless. By nothing I don't mean leisure activities like watching movies or hanging out. Nope. Pure nothingness.  

But this year there was a long overdue change. Now I have stuff to do and lucky for me I like those stuff.

A brief update on what I did so far: 

- Kept a journal; which is why I’m able to list these things in the first place. Unfortunately my memory is incapabale of remembering all these stuff on it's own.  
- Watched [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgtL4S7Hrwo) of [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum); author of Python language. [Reza](https://twitter.com/shalbafzadeh), a close friend, recommended it and I'll forever be thankful for it. It touched me and truly changed how I see the world. He told me he had similar feelings about the video.  
- Started learning Python 3 after that and fell in love with it.  
- Had long, deep conversations with a few of my friends. Something I rarely did in the past; but now I find vital; specially for mental well-being.  
- Read [an interesting biography of Elon Musk](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1583135575). It was motivating with an enjoyable and easy-to-read writing. Totally recommended.  
- Went on a road trip with family and had a splendid time.  
- Spent a day in a startup accelerator in Tehran, and observed the atmosphere and the work flow.  
- Started drafting a lesson plan for a [‘everyday *nix’ class](https://github.com/mohsend/everyday-nix).  
- Went to a gathering with many of the old and late friends and had a blast.  
- Started learning to sing in a choir. [Sina](https://www.instagram.com/sinaswebz/), A good friend of mine, was kind enough to tutor a few of his friends and started an amateur choir. He chose ['Moon river'](http://www.gasworkschoir.co.uk/node/11) as our first song to rehearse. I'm singing the Tenor part.   
- [Tweaked a Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mohsend/the-plain) to support right-to-left languages for a [friend’s blog](http://pe42.ir/). It’s a really nice, minimal, and overall well-made theme. I’m considering using it for this blog too.  
- And a lot of other insignificant things that don’t look like much, but are the first steps for doing significant things down the road.  

Hopefully by listing these here, I'll motivate myself and maybe you to do more, to do greater! We all can be a bit better, a bit happier, every passing day.
