A while back my cousin suggested that we go on a night hike to the [Tochal peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tochal)
like we did a few years back.
I agreed on the spot since I'm always up for a good hike.
We planed on starting the hike on 6 P.M., August 15. A night with near full moon shinning all night.
Hiking under moonlight is an unmatched feeling.
As we ascended, we talked and catched up with each other.

We didn't make it in time to get into and spend the night in the [Shirpala shelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirpala_shelter).
We rested behind its shut door a bit then carried on.

I spent some time taking pictures of the night sky.

Finally at 4 A.M. we decided that we are too sleepy to go on; and the moon was setting too.
We slipped into our sleeping bags and dosed off quickly afterwards.

One and half hour later we woke up because we were freezing.
We lighted a bush and savored the heat!
As soon as the fire was out; we started moving not to freeze again.

From then on we continued (rather slowly) till we reached the top.
All through the hike we met amazing people and felt challenged all the time.
