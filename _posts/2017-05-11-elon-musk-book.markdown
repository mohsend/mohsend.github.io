Here goes the story of a friendship,
how I got introduced to a book,
how and for what I use my Kindle, and why you may want to own one.

## Friendship...

The story begins by a message in Telegram[^telegram] from [Amir]($$$), one of my closest friends. 
It was just a single link with no description. 
The actual conversation in its entirety is as follows:

> Amir, [05.03.16 18:36]  
[http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html)  

> Mohsen, [05.03.16 21:32]  
[In reply to Amir]  
added to pocket. will read on kindle. thanks.  

This kind of telegraphic conversations is one of the reasons I cherish my friendship with Amir.
*We can skip formalities.*
In part it's because I trust his opinion and taste so much so
that I'm sure the content of the link is of quality.
He doesn't have to explain why I should check it out.

## ...Kindle...

The link, like other long reads, went strait to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com "Pocket is your place to quickly save, discover, and recommend the best, most interesting stories on the Web") and waited for [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/ "calibre - E-book management") 
to retrieve my Pocket articles using 
[Pocket+ plugin](https://github.com/mmagnus/Pocket-Plus-Calibre-Plugin "Pocket+ recipe for Calibre"). 
Calibre then makes a nice 'issue'[^issue] out of those; and finally emails the issue to the Kindle. One of the conveniences of a Kindle is that you can email a document to it and it'll show up in your Kindle.[^send] 
The issue waited till I turned on the wi-fi. 

With the issue downloaded, all I had to do next was to open the Issue, and read the post. 
13 days after the initial introduction to the article; 
I finally started reading it. 

The illustrations of the article are *really funny*. The article is Part 1 of a four-part series on Elon Musk's companies.
To be honest I skipped the other three. What I did instead was to mark the biography book mentioned in the article, ['Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future' by Ashlee Vance](
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22535480-elon-musk "View the book on Goodreads.com"), as 'to-read' in Goodreads.
And getting it on my Kindle after that. At the time I was (and in the time of writing this still am)
halfway through ['The Picture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar Wilde](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5297.The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray "View the book on Goodreads.com") ---recommend by another friend. I have to admit while the characters are well developed and the writing is rock solid and I kinda enjoy reading it, classics are not for me; as it seems to take me forever to finish them. But they are usually in public domain and free, therefore economical choices for reading.[^gutenberg]

It took me a long time to finish this review of the book and that would have been impossible to do without the highlight feature. It can be a real timesaver to have all of your notes and highlights of a book in a list.

```I'm writing this months after finishing the book and I can't imagine doing this without reviewing the highlights.  Reviewing highlights of a book can freshen the whole experience. You can recall nearly all the book which results in a deeper influence.```

## ...Elon Musk

It took me more than two months to finally open the book and start reading it.
The irrational guilt associated with starting a book while I haven't finished the last one yet was to blame.
All the same, a month after that the 400-page book was finished.

Near the end of the book, I wished it never ended.
I couldn't get enough of the fascinating (true) story I was reading.
Lucky for me ---and all of us, really--- he is alive and well and in his golden years. Hardly any day passes without him or one of his companies making headlines. Following the news around him is somehow reading the book after its end.


More than anything, for me, the book was a huge motive to work hard. Musk and employees' superhuman work ethic is the ever prominent topic in the book. As one [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/SpaceX) intern puts it, "You can work whatever 80 hours a week you want".[^intern] This way of work was in dire contrast with the chill atmosphere portrayed in the book I read before this, [How Google Works](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158207-how-google-works). And all that hard work actually sounded so fulfilling and rewarding. And for a few glorious days I was working more than I ever did.   

There was dark sides to this hardworking startup genius too and the book did not shy away from those at all. Musk's impatience on what appears to a normal human being as trivial and disrespect for his employees opinions and his (dare I say deserved) huge ego cost his businesses a lot of top talents.
