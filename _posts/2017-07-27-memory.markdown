Iâ€™m a night owl. The silence and the darkness of the nights are things I seek. Makes for a clearer head in my opinion.

I remember, in our late home, there was absolute silence at nights. Hardly anything noisy was going on. But the things that did occasionally made a sound, had the chance to be heard fully and with clarity. The one thing I remember from every night up, is the sound of sweeping.

Every night around 4 PM I could hear the sound of sweeping on the street below my window. It had a surprisingly calming quality to it. I would halt whatever I was doing and just listen. Sometimes I would go to the window and watch the sweeper as he worked his way down the street. This sound was my signal to call it a night and head to bed.

You were a valued companion in my sleepless nights Mr. sweeper. I miss you and wish you the best in life.

P.S. [Memory by Andrew Lloyd Webber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjgDxfqJci0) is a pleasant late night tune.
