﻿according to some study or something, a percentage of people never see the milky way in their life; and that you should not be in that percentage. Here’s what you should do.

first you pick a date with minimal moonlight, the beginning or end of lunar cycle. and a night with clear sky. you then drive to some place as far as possible from light pollution from cities. when you got there you place a mat on the ground and lie down on it. you avoid any kind of light, like your phone’s screen or headlights on your car. and you avoid looking at the sky above.

you lie down with your eyes closed, listening to silence; no music, no talking for five minutes. you give your eyes time to rest and adapt to the dark. and with minimal sensory input, your brain gets ready to process what’s about to come. and then you open your eyes to the sky above and see the same magical thing your ancestors used to saw. you see a wide stripe of white on the pitch black background. and thousands upon thousands of tiny balls of light all over this black dome. they look so close that if you just reach your hand a bit more you can grab them. but of course they are millions of light years afar.

about milky way: this white stripe is made up of billions of indistinguishable stars in our home galaxy, the milky way.

shooting stars: most of the time there are one or two meteor showers going on. check their places in advance and you’ll surly see a few shooting stars.

no image or video can come close to the sensation of seeing the thing in person.
